# Why?

## Motivation

Let's start with a few __basic, general questions:__

--

1. What is the goal of econometrics?

2. Why do economists (or other people) study or use econometrics?

--

__One simple answer:__ Learn about the world using data.

--

- _Learn about the world_ = Raise, answer, and challenge questions, theories, assumptions.

- _data_ = Plural of datum.

---
# Why?

## Example

GPA is an output from endowments (ability) and hours studied (inputs). So, one might hypothesize a model

$\text{GPA}=f(H, \text{SAT}, \text{PCT})$

where $H$ is hours studied, $\text{SAT}$ is SAT score and $\text{PCT}$ is the percentage of classes an individual attended. We expect that GPA will rise with each of these variables ( $H$, $\text{SAT}$, and $\text{PCT}$).

But who needs to _expect_?

We can test these hypotheses __using a regression model__.

---
layout: true
# Why?

## Example, cont.

__Regression model:__

$$ \text{GPA}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 H_i + \beta_2 \text{SAT}_i + \beta_3 \text{PCT}_i + \varepsilon_i $$

---

We want to test estimate/test the relationship $\text{GPA}=f(H, \text{SAT}, \text{PCT})$.

---

### (Review) Questions

--

- __Q:__ How do we interpret $\beta_1$?
--

- __A:__ An additional hour in class correlates with a $\beta_1$ unit increase in an individual's GPA (controlling for SAT and PCT).


--

- __Q:__ Are the $\beta_k$ terms population parameters or sample statistics?
--

- __A:__ Greek letters denote __population parameters__. Their estimates get hats, _e.g._, $\hat{\beta}_k$.

---

### (Review) Questions

- __Q:__ Can we interpret the estimates for $\beta_2$ as causal?
--

- __A:__ Not without making more assumptions and/or knowing more about the data-generating process.


--

- __Q:__ What is $\varepsilon_i$?
--

- __A:__ An individual's random deviation/disturbance from the population parameters.


---

### (Review) Questions

- __Q:__ Which assumptions do we impose when estimating with OLS?
--

- __A:__
  - The relationship between the GPA and the explanatory variables is linear in parameters, and $\varepsilon$ enters additively.
  - The explanatory variables are __exogenous__, _i.e._, $E[\varepsilon|X] = 0$.
  - You've also typically assumed something along the lines of:<br> $E[\varepsilon_i] = 0$, $E[\varepsilon_i^2] = \sigma^2$, $E[\varepsilon_i \varepsilon_j] = 0$ for $i \neq j$.
  - And (maybe) $\varepsilon_i$ is distributed normally.

layout: false

# Assumptions

## How important can they be?

You've learned how **powerful and flexible** ordinary least squares (**OLS**) regression can be.

However, the results you learned required assumptions.

**Real life often violates these assumptions.**

--

EC421 asks "**what happens when we violate these assumptions?**"
- Can we find a fix? (Especially: How/when is $\beta$ *causal*?)
- What happens if we don't (or can't) apply a fix?

OLS still does some amazing thingsâ€”but you need to know when to be **cautious, confident, or dubious**.

---

# Not everything is causal

```{R, spurious, echo = F, dev = "svg"}
tmp <- data.frame(
  year = 1999:2009,
  count = c(
    9, 8, 11, 12, 11, 13, 12, 9, 9, 7, 9,
    6, 5, 5, 10, 8, 14, 10, 4, 8, 5, 6
  ),
  type = rep(c("letters", "deaths"), each = 11)
)
ggplot(data = tmp, aes(x = year, y = count, color = type)) +
  geom_path() +
  geom_point(size = 4) +

# Econometrics

An applied econometrician<sup>â€ </sup> needs a solid grasp on (at least) three areas:

1. The __theory__ underlying econometrics (assumptions, results, strengths, weaknesses).

1. How to __apply theoretical methods__ to actual data.

1. Efficient methods for __working with data__â€”cleaning, aggregating, joining, visualizing.

.footnote[
[â€ ]: _Applied econometrician_ .mono[=] Practitioner of econometrics, _e.g._, analyst, consultant, data scientist.
]

--

__This course__ aims to deepen your knowledge in each of these three areas.

--

- 1: As before.
- 2â€“3: __R__

## What is R?

To quote the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org):

> R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

--

What does that mean?

- R was created for the statistical and graphical work required by econometrics.

- R has a vibrant, thriving online community. ([stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r))

- Plus it's __free__ and __open source__.

---

## Why are we using R?

1\. R is __free__ and __open source__â€”saving both you and the university ðŸ’°ðŸ’µðŸ’°.

2\. _Related:_ Outside of a small group of economists, private- and public-sector __employers favor R__ over .mono[Stata] and most competing softwares.

3\. R is very __flexible and powerful__â€”adaptable to nearly any task, _e.g._, 'metrics, spatial data analysis, machine learning, web scraping, data cleaning, website building, teaching. My website, the TWEEDS website, and these notes all came out of R.

---

## Why are we using R?

4\. _Related:_ R imposes __no limitations__ on your amount of observations, variables, memory, or processing power. (I'm looking at __you__, .mono[Stata].)

5\. If you put in the work,<sup>â€ </sup> you will come away with a __valuable and marketable__ tool.

6\. I ðŸ’– __R__

## Some R basics

You will dive deeper into R in lab, but here six big points about R:

.more-left[

1. Everything is an __object__.

1. Every object has a __name__ and __value__.

1. You use __functions__ on these objects.

1. Functions come in __libraries__ (__packages__)

1. R will try to __help__ you.

1. R has its __quirks__.

]

.less-right[

`foo`

`foo <- 2`

`mean(foo)`

`library(dplyr)`

`?dplyr`

`NA; error; warning`

]

---

## R _vs._ .mono[Stata]

Coming from .mono[Stata], here are a few important changes (benefits):

- Multiple objects and arrays (_e.g._, data frames) can exist in the same workspace (in memory). No more `keep`, `preserve`, `restore`, `snapshot` nonsense!

- (Base) R comes with lots of useful built-in functionsâ€”and provides all the tools necessary for you to build your own functions. However, many of the _best_ functions come from external libraries.

- You don't need to `tset` or `xtset` data (you can if you really want... `ts`).
